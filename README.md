  ## Description

  ## Installation 
  To install, simply clone the repository into your bash or shell, and run an `npm i` to download the required dependencies. You will then be ready to use the note taker!
  
  ## Usage 
  To start the application, run `npm start` in your command-line. It will then start a server locally. If this is successful, it will say 
  
                    Server now running on your port!

  After your servers up and running, you can navigate to your localhost: in the browser, it will tell you which port it is running on in the console. You will then be greeted with the landing page. Go ahead and press `Get Started`.
